## 🚀 Features
- ⚖️ **Physics Engine** — Simulates gravitational interactions with numerical integration via `scipy.solve_ivp`.  
- ⏱ **Adaptive Timestepping** — Maintains stability across fast and slow orbital regimes.  
- 🔋 **Energy Conservation Checks** — Tracks kinetic, potential, and total system energy.
  
- 🎨 **Visualizations**  
  - **Pygame (real-time)** — Interactive orbit visualizer with trails, scaling, and live info.  
  - **Matplotlib (analysis)** — Detailed orbital trajectory plots and energy trends.
      
- 🪐 **Predefined Systems** — Earth–Moon and Binary Star examples included.
